## What is VMware Site Recovery

![SRM4](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM4.jpg)

VMware Site Recovery brings VMware enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) Disaster Recovery as a Service to the AWS Cloud. It enables customers to protect and recover applications without the requirement for a dedicated secondary site. It is delivered, sold, supported, maintained and managed by VMware as an on-demand service. IT teams manage their cloud-based resources with familiar VMware tools without the difficulties of learning new skills or utilizing new tools and processes.

Wait until the Site Recovery Add On has been activated. This process should take ~10 minutes to complete.

VMware Site Recovery is an add-on feature to VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS integrates VMware's flagship compute, storage, and network virtualization products: VMware vSphere, VMware vSAN, and VMware NSX along with VMware vCenter Server management. It optimizes them to run on elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure. With the same architecture and operational experience on-premises and in the cloud, IT teams can now get instant business value via the AWS and VMware hybrid cloud experience.

The VMware Cloud on AWS solution enables customers to have the flexibility to treat their private cloud and public cloud as equal partners and to easily transfer workloads between them, for example, to move applications from DevTest to production or burst capacity. Users can leverage the global AWS footprint while getting the benefits of elastically scalable SDDC clusters, a single bill from VMware for its tightly integrated software plus AWS infrastructure, and on-demand or subscription services like VMware Site Recovery Service. VMware Site Recovery extends VMware Cloud on AWS to provide a managed disaster recovery, disaster avoidance and non-disruptive testing capabilities to VMware customers without the need for a secondary site, or complex configuration.

VMware Site Recovery works in conjunction with VMware Site Recovery Manager and VMware vSphere Replication to automate the process of recovering, testing, re-protecting, and failing-back virtual machine workloads. VMware Site Recovery utilizes VMware Site Recovery Manager servers to coordinate the operations of the VMware SDDC. This is so that, as virtual machines at the protected site are shut down, copies of these virtual machines at the recovery site startup. By using the data replicated from the protected site these virtual machines assume responsibility for providing the same services.

![SRM5](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM5.jpg)

VMware Site Recovery can be used between a customers datacenter and an SDDC deployed on VMware Cloud on AWS or it can be used between two SDDCs deployed to different AWS availability zones or regions. The second option allows VMware Site Recovery to provide a fully VMware managed and maintained Disaster Recovery solution. Migration of protected inventory and services from one site to the other is controlled by a recovery plan that specifies the order in which virtual machines are shut down and started up, the resource pools to which they are allocated, and the networks they can access.

VMware Site Recovery enables the testing of recovery plans, using a temporary copy of the replicated data, and isolated networks in a way that does not disrupt ongoing operations at either site. Multiple recovery plans can be configured to migrate individual applications or entire sites providing finer control over what virtual machines are failed over and failed back. This also enables flexible testing schedules. VMware Site Recovery extends the feature set of the virtual infrastructure platform to provide for rapid business continuity through partial or complete site failures.

## Create a Cross SDDC VPN

We will be setting up an IPSEC VPN connection between your VPC and the VPC of the person you were paired with. **Each student** needs to complete the steps for **your** SDDC.

![SRM6](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM6.jpg)

1. Navigate back to *ALL SDDCs* and click on *VIEW DETAILS* for **the paired student's** SDDC.  For example, if you are *Student-1*, you will view the details for the *Student-2* SDDC.

    ![SRM7](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM7.jpg)

2. Click on the *Networking & Security*

    ![SRM8](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM8.jpg)

    In the Management Gateway section, make a note of the *VPN Public IP* and the *Infrastructure Subnet* CIDR

    ![SRM9](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM9.jpg)

### Create a Policy Based VPN
**Navigate back to the *VIEW DETAILS* section of *YOUR SDDC* to create the VPN to the *Paired Student's SDDC***

On the Networking & Security tab
1. Click *VPN* on the left-hand menu under Network
2. Click *Policy Based*
3. Click on *ADD VPN*

    ![SRM10](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM10.jpg)

    **Note that all workloads deployed in the module will be deployed to the *Demo-Net* Network Segment that was created in the *Working with your SDDC* module**

    Fill in the following information:
4. Enter *Student # MGMT GW* (where # is your peer's student number) in the *Name* field
5. Select *Public IP* for *Local IP Address*
6. Enter the *VPN Public IP* address of the persons Management Gateway you were paired with for *Remote Public IP*
7. Enter the paired student's Demo-Net Network Segment CIDR *10.10.x.0/24* where **X** is the paired student's number and enter the paired student's *Infrastructure Subnet CIDR* you noted earlier in the *Remote Networks* field
8. Click the *Local Networks* field and select both *Demo-Net* and *Infrastructure Subnet*
9. Enter **VMware1!** in the *Preshared Key* field
10. Click *SAVE*

    ![SRM11](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/srm-lab/SRM11.jpg)

    When both you and the person you were paired with have completed these steps you should see the status of the VPN turn to **Success**

## Deploy a Windows Jump Host
**DRaaS requires a form of private connectivity, not just between the two sites (SDDCs in this workshop environment) but also between the Site Recovery UI and the location you open it from.  As a result, accessing Site Recovery over the internet via public IP will not work. To address this, we will create a Windows Jump Host in our SDDC and RDP to that jump host to work with Site Recovery.**

**If you get a *Not configured* error when creating the protection groups, ensure under Site Pair that you have configured Placeholder Datastores for each side.  Once that is done, you will need to *Restore all Placeholder VMs* for each protection group**

### Create a Recovery Plan for All Applications

We will create another Recovery Plan that will recover all of our applications.  As stated before, a VM can only belong to one Protection Group, but a Protection Group can belong to more than one Recovery Plan.
