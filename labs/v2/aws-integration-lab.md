## Introduction

One of the most compelling reasons to adopt VMware Cloud on AWS is to integrate your existing systems which sit in your VMware Cloud environment, with application platforms which reside in your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. The intergration which VMware and AWS have created allows for these services to communicate, for free, across a private network address space for services such as EC2 instances, which connect into subnets within a native AWS VPC, or with platform services which have the ability to connect to a VPC Endpoint, such as S3 Storage.

## Understanding Integrations with AWS Services

![aws-1](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/aws-integrations/AWS-1.jpg)

As the above diagram illustrates, the VMware stack not only sits next to the AWS services, but is tightly integrated with these services. This introduces a new way of thinking about how to design and leverage AWS services with your VMware SDDC. Some integrations our customers are using include:

* VMware front-end and RDS backend
* VMware back-end and EC2 front-end
* AWS Application Load Balancer (ELBv2) with VMware front-end (pointing to private IPs)
* Lambda, Simple Queueing Service (SQS), Simple Notification Service (SNS), S3, Route53, and Cognito
* AWS Lex, and Alexa with the VMware Cloud APIs

These are only a few of the integrations we've seen. There are many different services that can be integrated into your environment.
In this exercise we'll be exploring integrations with both AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and AWS Relational Database Service (RDS).

### How these integrations are possible

In addition to sitting within the AWS Infrastructure, there is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) connecting VMware Cloud on AWS and the customer's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), providing a high-bandwidth, low latency connection between the VPC and the SDDC. This is where the traffic flows between the two technologies (VMware and AWS). There are no EGRESS charges across the ENI within the same Availability Zone and there are firewalls on both ends of this connection for security purposes.

How is traffic secured across the ENI?

![aws-2](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/aws-integrations/AWS-2.jpg)

From the VMware side (see image below), the ENI comes into the SDDC at the Compute Gateway (NSX Edge). This means, on this end of the technology we allow and disallow traffic from the ENI with NSX Firewall rules. By default, no ENI traffic can enter the SDDC. Think of this as a security gate blocking traffic to and from AWS Services on the ENI until the rules are modified.

![aws-3](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/aws-integrations/AWS-3.jpg)

On the AWS Services side (see image below), Security Groups are utilized. For those who are not familiar with Security Groups, they act as a virtual firewall for different services (VPCs, Databases, EC2 Instances, etc). This should be configured to deny traffic to and from the VMware SDDC unless otherwise configured.

![aws-4](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vmc-workshops-images/aws-integrations/AWS-4.jpg)

In this exercise, everything has been configured on the AWS side for you. You will however walk through how to open AWS traffic to come in and out of your VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC.

## AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) Integration

Amazon RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost- efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

In this exercise, you will be able to integrate a VMware Cloud on AWS virtual machine to work in conjunction with a relational database running in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that has been previously setup on your behalf.

### Make Note of Webserver01 IP Address

Congratulations, you have successfully logged in to the photo app!

OPTIONAL: Feel free to take a picture of the room with your smart phone and upload it to the Public folder.

In summary, the front end (web server) is running in VMware Cloud on AWS as a VM, the back end which is a MySQL database is running in AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) and communicating through the Elastic Network Interface (ENI) that gets established upon the creation of the SDDC.

You have completed the AWS Integraton Lab.
