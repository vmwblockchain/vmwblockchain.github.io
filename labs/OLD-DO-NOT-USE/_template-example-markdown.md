# Introduction

<!-- Write a short introduction to the lab -->

## Level 2 heading 1

<!-- Treat level 2 headings as a main section of your lab, for example if this lab main section category is PowerShell Integration, this would come under a Level 2 heading -->

### Level 3 heading 1

<!-- Level 3 headings are used for subsections within the same category, think of them as step sections within your main category. If our Level 2 heading is PowerShell Integration, then a Level 3 section may be "Install PowerCLI" as a shorter lab step-->

### Level 3 heading 2

<!-- More content -->
