# Student Access

As VMware Cloud on AWS <https://vmc.vmware.com> is a publicly accessible service, you are able to use your local browser on your laptop for the majority of the interactions you will make with the platform during this training class. This may be helpful if you are using non-english language regional settings. However there are modules in this lab that require using PowerShell and the API tool, Postman, if you are using a Mac and do not have Powershell Core installed or if you do not wish to install Postman, you will then need to use the provided Horizon Desktop session in order to complete these tasks. Please see the details on accessing this environment below.

## Horizon Client Access

[Download VMware Horizon Client for your OS](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info?slug=desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_horizon_clients/4_0)

Downloaded the client and install.

Once you have the Horizon client running.

1. Click the *+* button to add a new connection server.
2. Enter the connection server name as **desktop.vmc.ninja**
3. You may be prompted to accept an untrusted certificate, please do so.

You will now have a new Horizon session to connect to named **desktop.vmc.ninja** please click on this connection and you will be presented with a login prompt for the desktop session you will use for the class.
